## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working through this project, I learned the basics of media queries and flexbox, how to set background images and how to add shadow effects.

```css

@media screen and (max-width: 600px), (min-width: 1200px) {
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row nowrap;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  align-items: center;
}

body {
  background-image: url("images/pattern-background-desktop.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 100% auto;
}

.white-bg {
  box-shadow: 0 30px 30px #dedbf8;
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on media queries and flexbox. I also want to start learning the basics of CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - This resource helped me understand what a flexbox is and how/when to use it.
- [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com) - This resource gave me an idea of which breakpoints to use in media queries.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This is my go-to resource when I need to use a property for the first time, such as background-image or box-shadow.
